# enumerations 

The repository contains:
* GatevaIvanova: Counterexamples to a conjecture of Gateva-Ivanova on retractability of square-free involutive solutions. Sizes: 8, 9, 10 and 11.
* IYB: Involutive non-degenerate solutions. The algorithm needs about 90 hours to compute all involutive solutions of size 9 up to isomorphism.  
* YB: Non-involutive non-degenerate solutions. The repository contains a database of non-involutive solutions of size <9.  
* strangeX: Strange binary operations. The repository contains database of strange tables of size 2, 3, 4 and 5. 
* biquandles: Biquandles of size 2..8.
